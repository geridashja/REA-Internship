Please streamline the process for foreign inward remittance for Indian startups - lots of filing work with bank branch + RBI

I'm not aware of anything optimized for this (reading in the thread that you want one container per request); so it might be worth writing custom code... Personally I'd start by benchmarking startup times with runc and seeing what needs to be shaven down!

Jan 221. list your startup
2. integrate Stripe for MRR
3. investors can request access
4. founder decides if to share or not

Free for founders. $299 per year for investors. Exactly like

 but instead of selling you can get funded.
